[**Anna Kiriliouk**](http://annakiriliouk.weebly.com/) (coordinator) ​is an assistant professor in Statistics at the Faculty of Economics, Social Sciences
and Business Administration and the Department of Mathematics of the University
of Namur (NaXys, UNamur). Her main research field is extreme value theory, with a focus on environmental applications, the development of statistical methodology for multivariate extremes, high-dimensional modelling, spatial extremes, and semi- and non-parametric inference. Recently, she has been particularly interested in topics related to the climate sciences, such as climate extreme event attribution and compound extremes.

[**Francesco Ragone**](https://uclouvain.be/en/directories/francesco.ragone) (coordinator UCLouvain) is assistant professor at the *Earth and Climate Centre* of the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) and  senior researcher at the Royal Meteorological Institute (RMI) of Belgium. My research interests focus on
the application of techniques from statistical physics and dynamical systems theory to the study of
climate problems.

[**François Massonnet**](https://www.climate.be/u/fmasson) is F.R.S.-FNRS Research Associate and part-time lecturer the *Earth and Climate Centre* of the UCLouvain. His research interests focus on seasonal to interannual predictability and prediction of sea ice, the evaluation of climate models in polar regions, data assimilation and forecast verification.

[**Johan Segers**](https://perso.uclouvain.be/johan.segers/index.html) is professor at the *Institut de statistique, biostatistique et sciences actuarielles* of the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain). His research is anchored in mathematical statistics and applied probability. His main research themes
are extreme value analysis, dependence modelling, optimal transport, and Monte Carlo integration.
