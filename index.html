    <p> EXALT (EXtreme weather Attribution at mid- and high-Latitudes using advanced statistical Techniques) is an interdisciplinary project that involves three research institutes: 
      the Namur Institute for Complex Systems (naXys) at UNamur, the Earth and Climate Center (part of ELI, the Earth and Life Institute) at UCLouvain, and the institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences (part of LIDAM, the Louvain Institute of Data Analysis and Modeling in economics and statistics) at UCLouvain.
      The PhD grants are financed through the Action de Recherche Concert´ee (ARC) called EXALT - EXtreme
weather Attribution at mid- and high-Latitudes using advanced statistical Techniques, under the supervision of prof. Francesco Ragone, prof. Franc¸ois Massonnet and prof Johan Segers from UCLouvain and prof. Anna Kiriliouk from UNamur. </p>
        
    <p>  The overall objective of EXALT is to introduce <b> a novel comprehensive framework for extreme event attribution </b>
and to apply it to the most influential events in the mid-high latitudes, namely heatwaves and
compound drought-heat events over Europe, floods in southern and northern Europe, and sea ice extent over
the Antarctic. Our attribution framework will (i) introduce <b> non-stationarity </b> in the extreme-value models, (ii)
be developed with a <b>multivariate mindset</b>, and (iii) deliver <b> reliable statistics </b> thanks to a meticulous choice
of study region (via clustering methods) and climate data (augmented through rare event algorithms).
      
Our proposed methods aim to better constrain the probabilities of occurrence of past and future
extreme events and to arrive at <b> robust attribution statements that do not understate (nor overstate)
the further risks that society will face. </b> </p>
